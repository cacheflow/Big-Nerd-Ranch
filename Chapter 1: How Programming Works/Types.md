#Types 
	1. In C you have to declare the type of a variable, so it can potentially alert you for problems and so it knows how much memory to allocate to that variable.
#Common Types 
	1. Short- A short has fewer bytes than a long.
	2. Int- An int is in between a short and a long.
	3. Long-Is used for much larger numbers.
	4. Float-Basically a number that has a decimal point. In memory this stored as a mantissa and an exponent.
	5. Double-A double is a double-precision number which are usuaully used to hold a longer mantissa and exponents.
	6. Char-A char is a one-byte integer or just a letter like "a"
	7. Pointer-Pointers hold a memory address. You declare them using an asterik sign. It doesn't hold the actual value, but if you know the address, you can get to it's value.
	8. Struct aka structure is a type made up of other types. 
#PEMDAS
	1. Bet you didn't think this would come in handy, huh? Well I've just relearned that in programming multiplication takes precedence in an expression and to change what gets executed first just wrap it in parenthesis.
