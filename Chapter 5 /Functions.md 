## Functions: 

1. Each parameter has two parts: The type of data the argument represents and the name of the parameter
2. Difference between arguments and parameters. Parameters are passed to the function or method on creation/declaration, but arguments are what are passed when the actual method or function is called. 
3. Each function has local variables that are usually declared and can only be accessed within that scope of the function.
